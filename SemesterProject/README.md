My semester project 2023. 

Brief: Design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web presence for the client using the provided image and text content.

The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum.

The client has not supplied a logo because the museum committee cannot decide on a final design. You are free to create a placeholder logo for the client.

Client: An interactive science museum called the *Community Science Museum* is opening soon near your location. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.
